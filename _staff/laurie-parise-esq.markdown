role: Executive Director and Founder
blurb: Laurie Parise is the Executive Director and Founder of Youth Represent. In
  2006, she was awarded an Echoing Green Fellowship to start the organization. Previously,
  as an Equal Justice Works Fellow, Laurie created and implemented a youth reentry
  project at the Legal Action Center’s National H.I.R.E. Network. Laurie’s youth reentry
  project expanded on the work of H.I.R.E. and addressed the unique employment issues
  that youth who have been involved in the juvenile or criminal justice system face
  when they reenter society. Laurie’s commitment to work with disenfranchised populations
  began in 1990 at the Rainforest Foundation, where she supported indigenous peoples
  in their efforts to protect their rights. After eleven years with the organization,
  the last five as its Executive Director, Laurie decided to go to law school to develop
  new skills in order to promote social justice in other segments of society. She
  is a graduate of Columbia University and Brooklyn Law School where she earned an
  Edward V. Sparer Public Interest Fellowship Award. In August 2005, she was awarded
  the first Lexis/Nexis Martindale Hubbell Legal Fellowship for her work in the field.
  In 2008, she received a Union Square Award in recognition of her grass roots activism
  to support at-risk youth in NYC.
